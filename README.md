Your mission and its importance within the team 
Your mission 
Your mission is to define the company's marketing strategies to bring OneTake AI, our artificial intelligence video editing software, to market through sales tunnels and orchestrated launches.

How you can make the difference
Your role is crucial: our company provides our customers with a unique service; but it's not enough to have invented a revolutionary product for it to sell itself.
The purpose of your role is to help us spread the word about our products and services, via our regular marketing events, to the 110,000 supporters signed up to our email newsletter and via sales tunnels. 
Your ONETHING is to create and maintain our sales systems to expand our customer base.
Your relationship with the team - direct and indirect impact of your role
Your new position
Currently, your duties are being carried out by Sébastien Night (Le Marketeur Français). When you first take on the marketing role, you'll be coached and trained by Sébastien to ensure you get off to an effective start. He'll gradually hand over the reins to you, and you'll stay in daily and then weekly contact with him for regular monitoring of marketing projects.
Dependencies
Because you're in charge of marketing, you have priority access to our resources, and we'll provide you with instructions on how to delegate technical tasks.
Passing the baton
The Marketing function (your role) liaises directly with other departments. In particular, when you're preparing a new campaign, you'll need to keep the Customer Service team, the Customer Success team and the Technical team informed of what you're planning. This way, these teams will know how to communicate with customers who have questions.
You'll need to keep an up-to-date diary of upcoming promotions 90 days in advance, as well as a list of current special offers.
Your responsibilities and scope for initiative
Before submitting your application
First of all, we'd like to save you time by letting you know right away whether or not you're right for the job:
Values
We can't work with someone who doesn't respect and apply the values we defend. 
They are set out here: 
Manifesto of the Free Entrepreneurs Movement
and here : 
Our Operating Principles: How we operate and take decisions
Initiative
If you see yourself as a mere executor, waiting to be given step-by-step instructions, you'll hate working with us. We give each team member a great deal of autonomy to carry out his or her assignments and projects. And in exchange for this autonomy, we want results, not excuses.
Procedures and systems
On the other hand, if you're a champion of improvisation and hate working within a framework... if the word "procedure" makes your skin crawl... you'll lose your hair in a few days with us.
Every repetitive task must be described in a procedure, and it's your responsibility to maintain the procedures that correspond to your role.
If Sébastien or another member of the team suggests a change in the way you carry out this or that mission, their final comment will always be - "and add that to your procedure, please". And we expect you to implement the change right away, so that we don't have to tell you about it again (since missions have to follow their own procedure... and your procedure is supposed to be up to date).
Expected results of your role in the first year
Let's look a year into the future:
Participate in the strategic thinking behind the various campaigns, and then take the lead once you've gained the necessary experience.
You have implemented marketing strategies to maintain an MRR increase of 20% per month.
You've planned our marketing campaign calendar 90 days in advance
You monitor the performance of our sales systems on a daily basis
You have adopted our company's core values, with a constant drive for personal development and skill enhancement.
You've taken charge of writing emails to our supporters - now under Sébastien's guidance, you've progressed and developed your copywriting skills; you've acquired the distinctive style that matches Sébastien's "voice", which we use in our communications with our customers.
You contributed to the development of your marketing department, overseeing the recruitment :
a copywriter to help you write the necessary materials (emails, pages, offers)
a webmaster to delegate the technical side (a task for which you will also be responsible on the first launches)
You have been a driving force within the team, suggesting strategic ideas and campaigns that continue to set us apart and bring ever greater value to our customers.
Thanks to your efforts, combined with those of the rest of the team, we have accelerated our growth, while increasing our "value per customer" and retaining our existing customer base.	
Success criteria: your role's performance indicators
The responsibilities and priorities of your role
For each campaign, take part in the strategic thinking behind the launch plan and the proposed offer; then take the lead once you have the necessary level of experience.
Prepare the "first draft" of the sales or pre-launch video scripts, based on the detailed instructions provided by Sébastien.
Write and send emails for each campaign, linked to the 4 stages of each Orchestrated Launch: Warning shot, Pre-launch, Launch, and Valve (post-launch).
Create marketing materials (example: powerpoint for a webconference; PDFs offered as a complement during the launch).
Maintain our marketing calendar so that campaigns and promotions are planned at least 90 days in advance.
Set up and manage the Marketing team: recruit, train, delegate tasks, create and update procedures.
You'll be able to draw on the many high-level resources at your disposal: Sébastien Night himself, in his capacity as a recognized marketing expert; but also the training courses we'll be making available to you; and the high-level Mastermind in which we'll be enabling you to participate.
Maintain and then accelerate our current launch pace.
Build and maintain our affiliate program
Build and maintain our social media funnels
The attitudes expected of you
Being a Finisher
You have to be committed to seeing your projects through to the end. You have to be a "finisher" and get through the last 10%, which sometimes feels like 90% more.
Our marketing calendar is tight. If you're stuck, or if a project isn't progressing at the expected speed, you have to proactively pass on this information. Good news is OK, bad news is OK, but if you don't report, and the project is behind schedule, it's a handicap for the whole team.
Caring marketing
Your role is to create the marketing content distributed on our newsletter. You'll create capture pages, email sequences, video scripts, sales pages, webconferences, and other components of "sales tunnels" (which we call "Toboggans").
All this content has to bring enormous value to our supporters, subscribers and readers.
Decision-making
You need to be able to put yourself in the customer's shoes and make the decision that will bring the most value to the customer.
If you're in any doubt about targeting an email to a particular list, you need to understand the implications of sending the email to someone on that list: is this email relevant? is it the 3rd email they'll receive that day? etc.? 
Project management (measuring results)
We'll give you projects and campaigns to run (usually with templates from our training courses or those of our partners).
It's up to you to see the project through to completion, and to monitor its execution by taking note of key metrics (registration rates on capture pages, email open and click rates, etc.). This data should be measured as the project is launched, not after the fact. If you're the type of person who likes to work "blind" and improvise without knowing whether the launch is going in the right direction or not, then you're not the person we're looking for.
Teamwork
You're a strong team player; you know how to work transparently. Several departments in the company depend on your decisions and your work; if you're a "black box", not only can the rest of the team not help you succeed in your launch, but you're also blocking them from their missions.
Availability
You need to be flexible enough with your schedule to adapt your workload over the week, so that the Launch can succeed. 
Important note: you are the person who decides the timing of the Launch (which day the webinars will take place and at what time, etc.). So you need to have the organizational and time management skills to meet the deadlines you've set (because you're the one who sets them!). With us, there's no burn-out (see Operating Principles 3 and 8).

Is this job for you?
This role is for you if :
You understand the basic principles of direct marketing and are familiar with online marketing and communication tools,
You're coachable; you want to put your skills to good use by being surrounded and advised by the best in the business (as part of this position, we'll sign you up for training courses and masterminds that will enable you to be trained and coached by some of the best marketers in the world),
You're a person of action: you know that the most perfect plan in the world is worthless if it isn't carried out, and you know how to pull out your MacGyver hat when necessary to ensure that the objective is achieved despite unforeseen circumstances and technical pitfalls,
You understand that you can't work "in isolation", and that each member of the team has an impact on the others. You understand the importance of communicating with members of the company's other departments with transparency, in order to be on the same wavelength when dealing with the customer;
You are ready to take responsibility for the projects entrusted to you, and to make decisions independently to ensure that these projects are successfully completed,
You like the idea of being the person "behind the scenes" on a major project. You know how to contribute to a common goal to achieve excellence in your part of the whole, even if you're not the person "in the spotlight";
You enjoy working within a rigorous framework; having procedures and best practices in place, so that the quality of the work delivered is constantly improving;
You're constantly on the lookout for ways to improve, so you monitor the results of your work and the marketing campaigns you put in place to measure their effectiveness and improve them;
You're looking for an opportunity to work with the best; to make a long-term commitment to a high-performance team; to give your best and always learn and grow; to see the impact of your work by supporting values and products you believe in.
